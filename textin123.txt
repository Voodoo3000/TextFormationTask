I became very nervous with the idea of  being enclosed and asked how he was  planning to  bury me. He  giggled like a child and began collecting dry branches. He did not let me help him and said I should sit down and wait.
He threw the branches  he was collecting inside the clean circle.  Then he made me lie down with my  head towards the east, put my  jacket under  my head, and made a cage around  my body.  He constructed it by sticking pieces of branches about two and a half  feet  in length  in the  soft dirt;  the branches, which ended in forks, served as supports for some long sticks that gave the cage a frame and the  appearance of an  open coffin. He closed  the box  like cage  by  placing small  branches and leaves over the long sticks, encasing me from the shoulders down. He let my head stick out with my jacket as a pillow.
He  then took a thick piece  of dry  wood and,  using it  as a  diggingstick,  he loosened the dirt around me and  covered  the  cage with it.  Theframe  was so  solid and the leaves were so well  placed  that no dirt  came inside. I could move my legs freely and could actually slide in and out.
