So far I  have  made no  attempt  whatsoever  to place don  Juan  in  a cultural  milieu. The  fact  that he considers himself  to be a Yaqui Indian does not mean that  his knowledge of sorcery is known to or practiced by the Yaqui Indians in general.
All  the conversations that  don  Juan  and I  have  had throughout theapprenticeship were conducted in  Spanish, and only because of  his thorough command of that language was  I capable of obtaining complex explanations of his system of beliefs.
I  have maintained the practice  of referring to that system as sorcery and I  have  also  maintained  the practice of referring  to don Juan  as  a sorcerer, because these were categories he himself used.
